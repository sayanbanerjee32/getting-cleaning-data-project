# getting-cleaning-data-project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
This outcome of this project is
1) a tidy data set as described 
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
