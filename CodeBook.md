Raw data collection
-------------------

### Collection

The data set was built from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
(walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded
to label the data manually.

The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of
the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

### Signals

The 3-axial time domain signals from accelerometer and gyroscope
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz . Then they were filtered
to remove noise.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

*  mean(): Mean value
*  std(): Standard deviation
*  mad(): Median absolute deviation 
*  max(): Largest value in array
*  min(): Smallest value in array
*  sma(): Signal magnitude area
*  energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
*  iqr(): Interquartile range 
*  entropy(): Signal entropy
*  arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
*  correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
*  maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
*  meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
*  skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal 
*  kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
*  bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT
   of each window.
*  angle(): Angle between some vectors.

No unit of measures is reported as all features were normalized and bounded
within [-1,1].

Data transformation
-------------------

The raw data sets are processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data
set .

### Merge training and test sets

Test and training data (X_train.txt, X_test.txt), subject ids (subject_train.txt,
subject_test.txt) and activity ids (y_train.txt, y_test.txt) are merged to obtain
a single data set. Variables are labelled with the names assigned by original
collectors (features.txt).

### Extract mean and standard deviation variables

From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the
values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain "mean") and standard
deviation (variables with labels that contain "std").

### Use descriptive activity names

A new column is added to intermediate data set with the activity description.
Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.

### Label variables appropriately

Labels given from the original collectors were changed:
* to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas
* to obtain more descriptive labels

### Create a tidy data set

From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric
variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.

The tidy data set contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:

*  an activity label (__Activity__): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
*  an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (__Subject__):
   1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
*  a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables (numeric)

The following table relates the 17 signals to the names used as prefix for the
variables names present in the data set. ".XYZ" denotes three variables, one for each axis.

Name                                  | Time domain                                 | Frequency domain
------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
Body Acceleration                     | TimeDomain.BodyAcceleration.XYZ             | FrequencyDomain.BodyAcceleration.XYZ
Gravity Acceleration                  | TimeDomain.GravityAcceleration.XYZ          |
Body Acceleration Jerk                | TimeDomain.BodyAccelerationJerk.XYZ         | FrequencyDomain.BodyAccelerationJerk.XYZ
Body Angular Speed                    | TimeDomain.BodyAngularSpeed.XYZ             | FrequencyDomain.BodyAngularSpeed.XYZ
Body Angular Acceleration             | TimeDomain.BodyAngularAcceleration.XYZ      |
Body Acceleration Magnitude           | TimeDomain.BodyAccelerationMagnitude        | FrequencyDomain.BodyAccelerationMagnitude
Gravity Acceleration Magnitude        | TimeDomain.GravityAccelerationMagnitude     |
Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude      | TimeDomain.BodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude    | FrequencyDomain.BodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude
Body Angular Speed Magnitude          | TimeDomain.BodyAngularSpeedMagnitude        | FrequencyDomain.BodyAngularSpeedMagnitude
Body Angular Acceleration Magnitude   | TimeDomain.BodyAngularAccelerationMagnitude | FrequencyDomain.BodyAngularAccelerationMagnitude

For variables derived from mean and standard deviation estimation, the previous labels
are augmented with the terms "Mean" or "StandardDeviation".

The data set is written to the file avg_by_act_sub_res.txt.
